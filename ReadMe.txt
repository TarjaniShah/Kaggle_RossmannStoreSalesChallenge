Rossmann Sales Analysis is a Statistical Modeling project, to predict factors affecting sales for Rossmann Stores.

The data was provided by kagggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales

Dataset contains data of 1115 stores over a period of 3 years.

Approach:
1. Data analysis and visualization of the variables

2. Outliers Analysis

3. Core hypothesis formulation

4. Ordinary Least square(OLS) assumptions check for creating a linear model.(The tests failed and hence couldn't choose a linear model)

5. Panel data modeling(as data is panel data, also known as logitudinal data, i.e. data is multi dimensional involving measures over the time)
    -- Fixed Model
    -- Pool Model
    -- Random effect Model

A detailed report can be found in PDF.

The folder also contain a Markdown file with the code and output.
